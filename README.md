Integrated ActionCable web socket for a realtime bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server. Implemented user authentication and authorisation using JSON Web Token (JWT). Used Material UI for styling.

This is a chat-app's backend. Run it with:

```rails db:migrate db:seed```  to migrate & seed the database.

Then to run 
```rails s```   => localhost:3000     (Ctrl + C to stop)

then run the chat-client frontend.
